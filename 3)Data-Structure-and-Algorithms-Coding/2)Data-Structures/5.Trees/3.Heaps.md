- A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. The heap property depends on the type of heap:

# Binary Heap:

- In a binary heap, for every node i other than the root, the value of i is greater than or equal to the values of its children. This property ensures that the smallest (for a min-heap) or largest (for a max-heap) element is always at the root.

# Priority Queue:

- Heaps are often used to implement priority queues, where each element has an associated priority, and the element with the highest (or lowest) priority can be efficiently retrieved.

- Common operations on heaps include insertion, deletion, and finding the minimum (or maximum) element, all of which can be performed in O(log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the heap.
