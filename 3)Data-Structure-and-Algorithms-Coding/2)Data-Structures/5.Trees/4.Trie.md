- A trie (pronounced "try") is a tree-like data structure used for storing a dynamic set of strings, where the keys are usually sequences, such as words in a dictionary. Tries are particularly useful for applications involving words, such as autocomplete suggestions or spell checking.

- In a trie:

1. Each node represents a character in a string.
2. The path from the root to a node forms a string.
3. Each node may have multiple children, each representing a possible next Character in the string.
4. Tries are efficient for searching for a specific key or prefix and can provide autocomplete suggestions by exploring the tree based on the input provided.
